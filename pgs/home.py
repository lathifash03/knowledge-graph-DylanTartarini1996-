    ## Graph RAG VS 'Normal' RAG
    This is a Demo Application to showcase the possibilities enabled by the
    Graph RAG approach.  
    For "Graph RAG" we mean [Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation) 
    grounded and contextualized not only via vector search or hybrid search 
    but also by querying a graph of entities and relationships using an LLM-powered agent 
    and then feeding the resulting context to another agent in charge of answering the 
    user's original question.  

    Explaining here the advantages of Retrieval Augmented Generation enriched with a Knowledge Graph 
    would be too long, but you can follow this [link](https://neo4j.com/developer-blog/knowledge-graphs-llms-multi-hop-question-answering/)
    to the Neo4j's Developer Blog.

    ## What's in the Demo?
    In this demo, pages of the Web App are used to serve different purposes:

    ## Prerequisites
    In order to showcase this approach to RAG, we will need some tools. 
    If you are using the Dockerized version of this app, some of them are already set up for you in the DockerFile. 
    * **Neo4j**: in this demo app, [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) is used both as a Vector Store as well as a Graph Database; 
        in fact, during the ingestion process, each Document is transformed in a node, 
        and from it `Chunk` nodes are extracted (with `embeddings` as metadata for that node), 
        while an agent is used to produce a graph representation of the content of the document. 
    * **Ollama/OpenAI/Groq API**: To power agents you will need LLMs and Embeddings models. 
        For this demo, available options are to either provide [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-api/) / [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/it-it/products/ai-services/openai-service) 
        API Key and endpoints or to have [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed in your machine. 
        You could also use the [Groq Cloud](https://console.groq.com/home) API if you want to test other open weights models
    * **Documents**: Documents coming from a specific domain to ingest; available formats are `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`, `.html`.
    * **Configuration**: in order for this Demo to work, you should either have all the settings for Neo4j, LLMs.. 
        inside your environment or a configuration file at the following path: `knowledge-graphs/config.env`. 
        See the repository's README for further details on the settings.
